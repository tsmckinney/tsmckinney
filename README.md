- 👋 Hi! My name's @tsmckinney
- 👀 I’m interested in game development and stuff like that.
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to teach myself computer coding. (Hopefully it goes well)
- 💻 Right now I'm working on a metafictional puzzle platformer called Evertab.
- 💭 I've got autism, so my head works a little differently. And I'm totally fine with that.😌
